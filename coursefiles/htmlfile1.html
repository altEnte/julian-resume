<h2>Bosses</h2>
<section>
    <h3>My boss "boss" / Unfulfilling job </h3>
    My boss is an influental person which really can affect my mood on a day to basis if he is in a bad state. He can attack with "annoying cat" where he complains about everything and over criticizes people around him. An attack of annoying cat damages stamina by 10 %. <p>Another attack would be that I don't really have any useful tasks that are fulfilling me in my daily routine. If an unfulfilling task will be coming in, stamina will decrease by another 10 %.</p>

    <h3>Fear of facing emotional stress or pain</h3>
    This boss is making it a lot harder to face ones problems because its strategy is it to keep me away from reality and the actual solution for the problem. When this fear kicks in I usually stay away from facing a situation and I am usually struggling more because I don't get anything done.
    <ul>
        <li>paralyze: an attack that will cost me 10 % stamina, 10 % health, 20 % mana and keep me from doing anything because my brain tries to keep me away from facing a problem because it is easier to do nothing for the moment.</li>
    </ul>
