This is my project with the purpose of learning to initialize a whole web dev project with create-react-app and it has the following key topics:
- use git locally and with remote repository
- publish webpage on a personal domain
- display personal motivation and information on a web app with react
- revisit basics of JS, React, HTML, CSS
